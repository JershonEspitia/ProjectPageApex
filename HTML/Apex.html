                        The job was perfect for her, until one day the lab where the fuel was being extracted self-destructed and she died.
                        Her brain was put in a simulacrum shell and she did come back as an android.

                        Artur taught them the old system that focuses on the glory of the nature, but Bloodhunt combined that knowledge
                        with technology to take down a Goliat that preyed on the people of their village.

                        Almost one hundred years ago, the Outlands were on the edge of a cataclysmic energy crisis.
                        The Dr. Mary an eccentric astrophysicist was hired to find a solution.
                        With the help of her apprentice, Dr. Reid, Mary discovered Branthium - an element she was convinced could be the key to limitless energy. 
                        But Branthium can be found only on the accretion disk of a black hole, so Mary and Dr. Reid departed on a dangerous mission to prove her theory right.

                        Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as guinea pig for her own experiments... whose partner betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed.

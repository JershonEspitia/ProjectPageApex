                            She was still very human when she learned that the only person who would care for her would be herself.
                            One day, a mercenary group hired her to steal an experimental fuel source being researched in Olympus.
                            The job was perfect for her, until one day the lab where the fuel was being extracted self-destructed and she died.
                            Her brain was put in a simulacrum shell and she did come back as an android.

                            Bloodhunt is known as one of greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen.
                            Bloodhunt was taken in by their uncle, Artur, after their parents died in an accident at the industrial plant.
                            Artur taught them the old system that focuses on the glory of the nature, but Bloodhunt combined that knowledge
                            with technology to take down a Goliat that preyed on the people of their village.

                            With the help of her apprentice, Dr. Reid, Mary discovered Branthium - an element she was convinced could be the key to limitless energy. 
                            But Branthium can be found only on the accretion disk of a black hole, so Mary and Dr. Reid departed on a dangerous mission to prove her theory right.

                        Artur taught them the old system that focuses on the glory of the nature, but Bloodhunt combined that knowledge
                        with technology to take down a Goliat that preyed on the people of their village.

                        The Dr. Mary an eccentric astrophysicist was hired to find a solution.
                        With the help of her apprentice, Dr. Reid, Mary discovered Branthium - an element she was convinced could be the key to limitless energy. 
                        But Branthium can be found only on the accretion disk of a black hole, so Mary and Dr. Reid departed on a dangerous mission to prove her theory right.

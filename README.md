## ABOUT
<strong>Apex Web Site</strong> is a class project about the video game Apex Legends developed by [Jershon Espitia](https://github.com/JershonEspitia).<br>
This web site is inspirated in the [original](https://www.ea.com/es-es/games/apex-legends) page. <br>
In this Web Site you can found information about the game and some legends with their abilities.

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

### Analysis:
The first step for the development of this project was the analysis of what was going to be done, and based on the original website, I took some ideas to implement them in mine.

### Design:
The second step was to create the designs (wireframes) of how I wanted my website to look, these are the mockups.

### Resource collection
The third step involved gathering information and translating the texts that were going to be placed on the website, as well as collecting the images.
